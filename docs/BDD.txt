Most of the Agile projects use User Stories. Example of User Story:
	
	"As a store owner, I want to add items back to stock when they are returned"

In BDD (Behaviour Driven Development) we split a Story into multiple Scenarios. Each Scenario is defined by a combination of:
Given <Stituation 1>
  And <Situation 2>
  And .....
When <Condition>
Then <Action>

So we start writing our test cases for each of the scenarios.

This perfectly matches with how we work with Mockito. We can do:

// Given - you setup the scenario
List list = mock(List.class);

// When - actual method call
when(list.get(1)).thenReturn("Something");

// Then
assertEquals("Something", list.get(1));
